# Summary

Code to generate a bezier-curve path to bring a mobile robot that has shifted from its planned trajectory by a particular distance (delta_x) and a particular angle (delta_theta), back on track.

The python script generates a veocity profile for the left and right wheels of the bot and compares the actual path with the generated bezier curve.
